###User Stories

* User could be anyone as the app will be highly personalized.

* User starts on landing page where they must create an account (Stretch is to implement Facebook or Gmail auth). There will also be a brief description of the app on the landing page.

* User is then taken to their personal desk (View of desk with multiple objects on it)

* User will hopefully be enticed to click around and explore without prompts. User can click on objects on the screen and they will then be routed to respective pages.

* User should be able to add personality to each section, be able to update, delete and view each submission they have made.

* User should be able to log out, and redirect to landing page.
